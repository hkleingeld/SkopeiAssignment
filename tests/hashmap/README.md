# 📝 Hashmap challenge

Oh no, some of our hashmap code is gone 😱. Please complete this hashmap, so we are able to keep track of our roles and employees again! If you have any questions, someone in the room might be able to help you. 

When completed, create your own public repository somewhere and push your work. Send an email to [jasper.smit@skopei.com](jasper.smit@skopei.com) and [emil.flach@skopei.com](emil.flach@skopei.com) with a link to this repository. Please also use the mail to describe any difficulties you ran into during this assignment.

Good luck! 👍
